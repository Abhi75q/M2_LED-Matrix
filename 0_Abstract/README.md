# Text Display on 8*8 LED Matrix Using atmega328
8x8 LED Matrix contains 64 LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) which are arranged in the form of a matrix, hence the name is LED matrix.
We are going to make this on SimulIDE.
The LEDs can be of any color. Then we will write a C program for ATmega328 AVR Microcontroller to control these 64 LEDs matrix.
The ATmega, according to program, powers appropriate LEDs to show characters in scrolling fashion.
